[Eye to Eye](https://eye-to-eye.herokuapp.com) is a collaborative drawing app.  Users draw on a canvas with simple color and brush size options, and will see every sketch drawn by other users who are on the site at the same time.

This project utilizes socket.io connections to share each sketch as it is drawn line by line.

Build with React, Express, and Socket.io
